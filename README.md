# dominion-game
This repository contains my personal project, a computer version of the card game Dominion. 

I have no prior experience with C++, so I am using this project as a learning experience over winter break. I am hoping by the end of winter break to have working gameplay functionality in a PTUI. After that, I likely will not have time to work on the project very much, but I would like in the future to complete it with some sort of GUI. 

Overall, the goal of this project is just to be a learning experience for me and to show to employers my coding skills outside of class projects, and also demonstrate how quickly I can pick up a completely foreign language.
