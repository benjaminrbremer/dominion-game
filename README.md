# dominion-game
This repository contains my personal project, a computer version of the card game Dominion. 

The plan for this project is to use it as a learning experience over winter break. I have no prior knowledge of C++, so I want to take this opportunity to both learn a new technology that is very relevant in-field, and also show employers that I am a quick learner and can pursue projects and learning opportunities outside of class.
